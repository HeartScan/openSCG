# OpenSCG ‚Äî Open-Source Cardiac Graph Infrastructure

Turn any smartphone into a live seismocardiography (SCG) sensor that doctors can watch in real time during a telemedicine call.

---

## ‚ö° TL;DR

**Problem:** Telemedicine still lacks objective cardiac data ‚Äì doctors rely on words, not signals.

**Solution:** OpenSCG streams raw accelerometer data from a patient‚Äôs phone and renders heartbeat waveforms for the clinician in seconds ‚Äì no app install, no extra hardware.

**Scope:** Patient PWA, ingestion API, live viewer, JSON spec, Docker deploy, MIT/Apache OSS. Proprietary ML module (peaks, arrhythmia) will be commercial/optional.

**Status:** Specification locked, code scaffolding next. Contributors welcome.

## 1. Why It Matters
- **Zero hardware barrier.** SCG uses the phone you already own.
- **True vital sign.** Waveform shows mechanical heart motion ‚Äì something video chat cannot.
- **Fills the telehealth gap.** Adds objective data before expensive RPM devices arrive.
- **Research booster.** Creates the first global open dataset of in-home SCG.

---

## 2. User Workflows

**Patient**
- Opens `https://openscg.org/` on phone (PWA).
- Create new session and get URL for viewing data.
- Places device on chest (mid-sternum or apex).
- Taps Start ‚Äì sensor data streams instantly.

**Clinician**
- Opens link in browser.
- Watches real-time waveform + BPM counter.
- Ends session ‚Üí data stored for later review.

_No logins for MVP ‚Äì tokenised URL is the key._

## 3. System Overview

- **Patient side (Browser):** A Progressive Web App (PWA) captures raw accelerometer data.
- **Backend Server (FastAPI):** Acts as a high-performance, real-time message broker and data archiver.
  - **Live Broadcast:** Immediately relays raw data to viewers via WebSockets.
  - **Data Persistence:** Buffers data in memory during the session and writes it to PostgreSQL when the session ends.
- **Viewer (Clinician side):** A React web app that receives the live data stream (and any buffered historical data on connection) and performs client-side interpolation and rendering.
- **REST API:** Provides endpoints to create sessions and retrieve full, raw data for completed sessions.
- **ML layer (Future):** An optional, proprietary module for advanced signal analysis.

```

- **Real-time Transport:** WebSockets for low-latency, bi-directional communication.
- **On-demand Transport:** A REST API for retrieving session data.
- **Processing:** Interpolation and rendering are handled on the client-side (viewer's browser).

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/sessions`: Creates a new measurement session.
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/end`: Ends a session and saves the buffered data.
- `GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/data`: Retrieves all saved raw data for a completed session.
- `GET /health`: A health check endpoint that verifies the server and database connection status.
- `WS /ws/{id}`: The real-time WebSocket endpoint.

## 8. Data Format ‚Äì OpenSCG JSON v0.1

**Sample Data Format**

The API uses the following format for accelerometer data points:

```json
{
  "t": 1743256991352,
  "ax": -5.2,
  "ay": 0.3,
  "az": 8.4
}
```

- `t`: Unix timestamp in milliseconds (int)
- `ax`, `ay`, `az`: Accelerometer readings (float)

See the full API contract in `docs/API_CONTRACT.yml`.
